# ML_Heart_Disease_Classification_Project

Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning
This project helps us to predict whether a person has heart disease or not using different features variables given to us in the data.

Tools:- The project is being made on Jupyter Notebook and libraries used are Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SeaBorn for Data Analysis and Scikit-Learn for Machine Learning Part

The following approach is being used to meet the evaluation metric in this project:-
Problem definition
Data
Evaluation
Features
Modelling
Experimentation

**Conclusion**
The project successfully managed to predict the heart disease of a person 8.9 times out of 10 thus having the accuracy score of 89%

**The Learnings**
1. How to do Exploratary Data Analysis(EDA)
2. How to use different machine learning tools efficiently to meet our evaluation goals
3. Experimentation-- to select the best model among various here the discarded models were KNN, SVC, RandomForest and selected model was Logistic Regression model
4. How to do Predictive Data Analysis(PDA) and compare it with EDA
5. How to Find the feature importance of the data given and how to imporve the model
